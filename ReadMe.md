# Datastructure Practice

This is the repo deticated for datastructures and algorithms practice. I have choosed java to practice because it is object oriented in nature.

Following are the datastructure that I practiced.
- avl-trees
- b-trees
- d-array
- d-stack
- graphs
- heep
- linked-list
- tries

Will add more information later...
